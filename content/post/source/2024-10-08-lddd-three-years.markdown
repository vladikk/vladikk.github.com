Frist of all, today is the 🐒 book’s birthday! 🎉

Exactly three years ago, <i>Learning Domain-Driven Design</i> was published! And what a birthday present the monkey received: today marks the official release of <i>Balancing Coupling in Software Design</i>! The new book is available in print and electronic formats on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3BIIPyk), [InformIT](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=XLXvHJZS*qY&mid=24808&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.informit.com%2Fstore%2Fbalancing-coupling-in-software-design-universal-design-9780137353484), and other major book stores 🎉

PS: And if publishing two books on the same date isn’t enough of a coincidence, yesterday marked the 5th anniversary of the release of my first book, What is Domain-Driven Design?
