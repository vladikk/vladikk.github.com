Last week I've needed a utility to convert a file containing json data to csv. I found many online solutions, but for some weird reason they didn't support nested objects and arrays. So I wrote one, this time in python.

Grab it here - [Github repository](https://github.com/vladikk/json2csv).

Usage
-----

``` bash
python json2csv.py "input_file.json" "output_file.csv"
```

If you pass in the following json file:
``` json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": {
      "first": "john",
      "last": "johnson"
    },
    "age": 27,
    "languages": [ "c#", "vb", "python" ]
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": {
      "first": "scott",
      "middle": "scottster",
      "last": "scottson"
    },
    "age": 29,
    "languages": [ "objective-c", "c++" ]
  }
]
```

You'll get the following csv file:
``` text
age, id, languages_0, languages_1, languages_2, name_first, name_last, name_middle
27, 1, c#, vb, python, john, johnson,
29, 2, objective-c,	c++, , scott, scottson, scottster
```
