description: >
  Balanced Coupling is a practical, modern framework for software design that helps engineers create modular, low-complexity systems by evaluating the trade-offs of coupling. Developed by Vlad Khononov, it builds on decades of design theory to provide a simple, effective tool for making better architectural decisions.

One of the most common pieces of feedback I received about [*Balancing Coupling in Software Design*](https://amzn.to/4irApMt) was that readers wanted a resource they could easily share with colleagues—a quick way to introduce the balanced coupling model and make discussions about it more accessible.

To meet that need, I created [coupling.dev](https://coupling.dev), a website that distills the core concepts of balanced coupling and related models into concise, approachable posts. It also serves as a hub for other learning resources, including conference talks and podcast appearances, helping teams streamline adoption and deepen their understanding together.

For now, all the content has been authored by me, but two guest posts are already in the works. If you’ve applied the model or have a story to share about your experience, I’d love to hear from you—reach out if you’re interested in contributing.
