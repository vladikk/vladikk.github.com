I’m a software developer with nearly 20 years of industry experience. During the years I worked for companies large and small, in roles ranging from Software Engineer to Chief Architect. 

When away from work, I maintain an active media career as public speaker and blogger. I’m speaking and writing on topics such as Microservices, Domain-Driven Design, and more. Alongside the media work, I have a keen professional interest in Distributed Systems, Software Architecture, and Software Design in general. 

In the remaining time, I read lots of books, fly R/C aircrafts, and rescue troubled animals.
