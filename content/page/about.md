Having over 18 years of experience in the software industry, I've worked across multiple business domains, including advertisement, healthcare, telecommunications, and customer acquisition. Currently I serve as the Chief Architect for Internovus, where I'm in charge of large-scale projects, and an international developers team.

My main areas of interest are Domain-Driven Design, Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing and building effective teams.

When I'm not geeking out, I read lots of books, photograph nature, and repair my r/c aircrafts.
