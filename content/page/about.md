Vladik (Vlad) Khononov is a software engineer with over 15 years of industry experience, during which he has worked for companies large and small in roles ranging from webmaster to chief architect. Vlad is a long-time proponent of domain-driven design and evolutionary architecture and currently helps companies make sense of their business domains, untangle monoliths, and tackle complex architectural challenges.

Vlad maintains an active media career as a public speaker and blogger. He has spoken at numerous industry conferences — including O’Reilly Software Architecture, DDD Europe, and NDC — about subjects such as domain-driven design, microservices, and software architecture in general. In addition to his media work, he co-organizes the Domain-Driven Design Israel and Tel Aviv Software Architecture meetup groups.

Vladik lives in Northern Israel with his wife and an almost-reasonable number of cats.
