During the last few years I spoke at leading software engineering conferences, e.g. O'Reilly Software Architecture, NDC, DDD Europe, and more. My topics include Domain-Driven Design, microservices, TDD, modular design, evolutionary architecture, and software arechitecture in general.

Feel free to [reach out](/page/contact) if you'd like me to speak at your conference or on-site event.
