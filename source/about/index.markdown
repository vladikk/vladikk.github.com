I am a software engineer with over 10 years' expertise in building web and enterprise applications for leading Israeli and global companies. Currently I serve as a Software Architect for Plexop, an Israeli-based startup company. 

I hold a BA (with distinction) in management and computer sciences from the Open University of Israel and aim to constantly widen my knowledge in the area of software development technologies and best practices.
