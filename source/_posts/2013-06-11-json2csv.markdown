description: Open source utility that converts json files to csv
---

Last week I've needed a utility to convert a file containing json data to csv. I found many online solutions, but for some weird reason they didn't support nested objects and arrays. So I wrote one, this time in python.
Grab it here - [Github repository](https://github.com/vladikk/json2csv).

Usage
-----

```
python json2csv.py "input_file.json" "output_file.csv"
```

If you pass in the following json file:
``` json
[
	{
		"id": 1,
		"name": {
			"first": "john",
			"last": "johnson"
		},
		"age": 27,
		"languages": [ "c#", "vb", "python" ]
	 },
	 {
	 	"id": 2,
	 	"name": {
	 		"first": "scott",
	 		"middle": "scottster",
			"last": "scottson"
	 	},
	 	"age": 29,
	 	"languages": [ "objective-c", "c++" ]
	 }
]
```

You'll get the following csv file:
``` text
age,  id,	languages_0,	languages_1,	languages_2,	name_first,	name_last,	name_middle
27,	1,		c#,				vb,				python,			john,		johnson,
29,	2,		objective-c,	c++,			,				scott,		scottson,	scottster
```
