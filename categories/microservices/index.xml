      <title>Event-Driven Architecture on AWS, Part III: The Hard Basics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://vladikk.com/2024/10/12/aws-eda-ii/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; in this series discussed the reliability issues many messaging-based systems suffer from and how to address them by implementing the outbox pattern. This post switches the focus from publishing to processing messages published by other components of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, I will start by defining the problem we have to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the outbox pattern once more. It addresses the common problem of publishing messages after the underlying business transaction has already been committed: the events might not get published at all. By implementing the pattern, you ensure that all the events will be published—&lt;em&gt;at least once&lt;/em&gt;. Let me explain the last part.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Event-Driven Architecture on AWS, Part II: The Advanced Basics</title>
      <link>https://vladikk.com/2024/10/12/aws-eda-ii/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://vladikk.com/2024/09/28/aws-eda/&#34;&gt;previous post in the series&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed the basic building blocks for implementing event-driven architecture (EDA) using AWS managed services. This post is about the &lt;em&gt;advanced&lt;/em&gt; basics. It’s advanced because, based on my consulting experience, very few companies apply the practices I want to discuss. However, I still consider this as basics because these practices are not optional but essential for implementing reliable messaging-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the examples in this post use AWS services, the material applies to any system, regardless of the infrastructure it runs on. The implementation might differ, but the underlying principles remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this post is about a pattern—and patterns, by definition, are repeatable solutions to commonly occurring problems—I want to begin by discussing a commonly overlooked problem in EDA-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, I suggested using AWS SNS for publishing messages in an event-driven system. Here’s a common example of how such publishing is carried out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;...

sns.publish(
    TopicArn=users_topic_arn,
    Message=json.dumps({
        &#39;event_type&#39;: &#39;user_registered&#39;,
        &#39;event_id&#39;: str(uuid.uuid4()),
        &#39;user_id&#39;: &#39;USER12345&#39;,
        &#39;name&#39;: &#39;John Doe&#39;,
        &#39;email&#39;: &#39;john.doe@example.com&#39;,
        &#39;source&#39;: &#39;mobile_app&#39;,
        &#39;registration_date&#39;: &#39;2024-10-11T20:01:00Z&#39;
    })
)

...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, an event of type &lt;code&gt;user_registered&lt;/code&gt; is published to an SNS topic. But did that event come from thin air? Is that all services do, just publish messages? Of course not. The event is part of a larger business process that typically involves updating some state in an operational database before notifying external components about it. A more accurate representation of this process would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Event-Driven Architecture on AWS, Part I: The Basics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The abundance of services provided by AWS often makes it possible to implement the same functionality in different ways. In the case of messaging systems, AWS offers services such as Simple Notification Service (SNS), Simple Queue Service (SQS), EventBridge, Kinesis, and Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK). It may seem that at least a subset of these services duplicates the same functionality. In this post, I want to describe my go-to architecture and explain why, in my opinion, it is the simplest, most cost-effective, and robust solution for the majority of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;event-driven-architecture&#34;&gt;Event-Driven Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Components of an event-driven system communicate by publishing and subscribing to events. The asynchronous integration offers significant non-functional advantages. For example, it decouples the integrated components’ lifecycles. To a certain degree, the system can keep functioning even in the face of unavailability of some of its services, thus also reducing the coordination overhead needed to deploy updated components, and to evolve the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic event-driven integration is comprised of two parts: a component of the system can publish events describing important occurrences in its lifecycle, and it can react (subscribe) to events published by other parts of the system. Let’s see what managed services we can leverage for implementing this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Untangling Microservices, or Balancing Complexity in Distributed Systems</title>

&lt;p&gt;The microservices honeymoon period is over. Uber is refactoring thousands of microservices into a more manageable solution [1]; Kelsey Hightower is predicting monoliths are the future [2]; and even Sam Newman is declaring that microservices should never be the default choice, but rather a last resort [3].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s going on here? Why have so many projects become unmaintainable, despite microservices’ promise of simplicity and flexibility? Or are monoliths better, after all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to address these questions. You will learn about common design issues that turn microservices into distributed big balls of mud – and, of course, how you can avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Anti-Pattern: Optimistic Consistency</title>

      <description>Ladies and Gentlemen, lo and behold a new consistency model - “Optimistic Consistency”. Implementation of this pattern is quite simple: commit as many transactions as you want, against as many storage mechanisms as you need. That’s all. Let’s see an example.
Example Say as the result of some user’s operation the system has to:
 Modify data in MongoDB Publish some events to Kafka Update search model in Elasticsearch; and Execute an operation on some remote system  You implement this logic by executing those operations one after another.</description>

      <title>Tackling Complexity in Microservices</title>
      <link>https://vladikk.com/2018/02/28/microservices/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Microservices have taken our industry by storm. Teams around the world have ditched their clumsy monoliths in favor of chasing the dream of loosely coupled, manageable, and independently deployable microservices. Unfortunately, many of them ended up worse off than they were before - in the realm of distributed monoliths. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I had an hour to solve a problem I&amp;rsquo;d spend 55 minutes thinking about  the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions” - Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this quote is the key to solving most of the issues we have when designing microservices-based systems. We rush into solutions without ensuring we know what exactly a microservice is. In this post, I’d like to take a stab at answering this question.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bounded Contexts are NOT Microservices</title>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always considered Domain-Driven Design’s Bounded Context as a guideline for defining the boundaries of Microservices. I was wrong. Not only is this heuristic flawed, but Bounded Contexts are the exact opposite of Microservices! To explain this point of view, I’ll start with a quick refresh of what Bounded Contexts are; then I’ll discuss the relationship between Bounded Contexts and Microservices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
