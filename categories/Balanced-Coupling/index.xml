      <title>AI Doesn&#39;t Fix Your Real Bottleneck</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://vladikk.com/images/ai-toc.png&#34; alt=&#34;An assembly line where an AI robot speeds up code production, creating a massive pile of blocks in front of an overwhelmed human operator with a warning alarm — illustrating how accelerating code generation creates a bottleneck at human comprehension.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every other post on my feed celebrates how AI lets us write code faster: whole apps built in a matter of a few hours, 99% AI-generated codebases, hundred-fold productivity gains, and on and on. But does writing code faster actually make us more productive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-quick-detour-through-a-factory&#34;&gt;A Quick Detour Through a Factory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Theory of Constraints says that every system&amp;rsquo;s throughput is limited by a single constraint: its bottleneck. What makes a system more effective? Improving the bottleneck. What makes a system less efficient? Improving anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, that second part is counterintuitive. Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: if you speed up a non-bottleneck, you don&amp;rsquo;t improve the system; you produce more work-in-progress that piles up in front of the bottleneck! More inventory. More cost. More waste. The system becomes more expensive to operate, not more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a well-established principle in manufacturing, and software manufacturing is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
