      <description>&lt;p&gt;One simple question can shed a lot of light on one’s competency in a given field: &amp;ldquo;On a scale of 1 to 10, please rate your knowledge of [enter-name-of-the-field-here]&amp;ldquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can assume that the higher the grade, the better. But that’s not the case at all. Why? Science — that’s why. Enter the Dunning-Kruger effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dunning-kruger-effect&#34;&gt;The Dunning-Kruger Effect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias that suggests that one cannot objectively assess one&amp;rsquo;s own abilities. It’s all about the unknowns — things that you don’t know — and whether you&amp;rsquo;re aware of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The less expertise you have in a given field, the more unknown unknowns you have. You cannot objectively evaluate your knowledge, and, consequently, you are mistakenly assessing your abilities to be much higher than they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bias also works the other way around. The more expertise you have in a given field, the more known unknowns you have. This awareness of things you don&amp;rsquo;t know tricks you into making a more humbling assessment of your abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
